Instructions for the Compilation of Spex
----------------------------------------


The Spex code requires the following libraries to be installed on your system: 
LAPACK, BLAS, FFTW3, HDF5, and Wannier90 if the code is to be compiled with 
Wannier90 support. For the parallel version you need an MPI-3 compiler.

After unpacking the tar file with

$ tar xvzf spexVERSION.tgz
$ cd spexVERSION

the installation of Spex executables is done in three steps: configuration
(./configure script), compilation (make), and installation (make install).
Installation is optional.


(1) Configuration

Configuration is done with the configure script:

$ ./configure [OPTIONS]

The configure script provides a number of options to customize the build
process. The most important are
--enable-mpi          : Compile MPI parallel version (requires an MPI-3 compiler)
--enable-load         : Load wavefunctions from harddisc instead of keeping them in memory (experimental)
--with-fc=COMP        : Compile with (MPI) Fortran compiler COMP
--with-wan            : Build with Wannier90 support
--with-wan=DIR        : DIR is the location of libwannier.a if it is not in a standard directory
--with-dft=PROG       : By default, the interface to Fleur MaX Release 5.1 version 34 is compiled.
                        An interface to a different DFT code can be chosen with PROG being the 
                        code's name: 
                        --with-dft=fleur   prepares usage with FLEUR v0.26b (2019.03)
                        --with-dft=fleurR3     -- " --         FLEUR MaX Release 3 v0.27
                        --with-dft=fleurR5     -- " --         FLEUR MaX Release 5 version 33
                        --with-dft=fleurR5.1   -- " --         FLEUR MaX Release 5.1 version 34
--with-hdf5=DIR       : Root directory of HDF5 (must contain DIR/lib and DIR/include)
--with-libdir=DIR     : Extra directory(-ies) to search for libraries
--with-includedir=DIR : Extra directory(-ies) to search for include files
--prefix=PREF         : Installation directory (default is /usr/local)
                        (installation is optional)

After --with-libdir and --with-includedir, multiple directories can be specified by a quoted
space-separated list, e.g., --with-libdir="/usr/lib /usr/local/lib".

For fine tuning, the following environment variables can be defined before running configure
(or in one line: $ ./configure FC=gfortran).
FC      : Fortran compiler
MPIFC   : MPI Fortran compiler
FCFLAGS : Compiler flags
LDFLAGS : Linker flags
LDLIBS  : Additional libraries (-l<lib>)

Type
$ ./configure --help
for a full list.

The configure script tries to create a Makefile, with which Spex can
be compiled successfully but which is not necessarily an optimal Makefile. 

For example, make sure that the optimization level is set properly.
The configure script tries several options (-O, -O1, -O2), which are used
by most compilers. If this fails, the code might be compiled without
optimization, which may lead to very slow execution. 

Also, the libraries found by the configure script might not be optimal for 
efficiency.


(2) Compilation and installation

After successful configuration you can compile the Spex code with

$ make

The compilation creates the executables 
src/spex.inv   - for systems with inversion symmetry and without spin-orbit coupling,
src/spex.noinv - for systems without inversion symmetry or with spin-orbit coupling,
src/spex.extr  - data extraction utility.

The Spex launcher script (sh/spex and src/spex) simplifies running a Spex calculation.
The script either executes "spex.inv" or "spex.noinv" depending on the DFT data.

The executables (including the shell scripts of the sh directory) can be installed 
into PREF/bin [see option --prefix in (1)] with

$ make install

If the directory PREF/bin is in the PATH environment variable, Spex is run simply
with "spex".


(3) Upgrading

To upgrade to the latest version, run

$ ./upgrade

The "upgrade" script downloads, configures, and compiles the new source automatically.
One can also check if a new version is available with

$ ./upgrade --check

See the documentation (doc/spex.pdf or online http://spex.readthedocs.org) for details.
